      <p className="intro-text">
        I'm a full-stack developer with a strong foundation in both front-end and back-end technologies. 
        I recently completed my Computer Science degree and have built a variety of full-stack applications during school and independently like Unity game projects, Cyber Security, and Databases. 
        I enjoy building real-world tools that solve real problems using modern frameworks like React, Node.js, and PostgreSQL.
